NPM_Versioning

- when we are working with npm it is really important to undertand how versioning works with packages.

- this is where simantic versioning comes into picture - simantic versioning is a specification where the version is represented by 3 numbers
  						         that means the same thing for every developer.
						       - Where the 1st Num represents Major Verion Number
						       - And the 2nd Num represents Minor Verion Number
						       - And the 3nd Num represents Patch Verion Number
													

- When we try to install a package the package will be installed with the latest stable release


- But Sometimes we may require specific version of the package - To install a Specific Verion of the package Execute the command
							       - npm install <package_name>@<version> --save
							       - Ex 1 :- npm install lodash@3.3.0
							       - Ex 1 :- npm install moment@2.1.0
