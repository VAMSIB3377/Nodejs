NPM_Versioning

- when we are working with npm it is really important to undertand how versioning works with packages.

- this is where simantic versioning comes into picture - simantic versioning is a specification where the version is represented by 3 numbers
  						         that means the same thing for every developer.
						       - Where the 1st Num represents Major Verion Number
						       - And the 2nd Num represents Minor Verion Number
						       - And the 3nd Num represents Patch Verion Number
													

- When we try to install a package the package will be installed with the latest stable release


- But Sometimes we may require specific version of the package - To install a Specific Verion of the package Execute the command
							       - npm install <package_name>@<version> --save
							       - Ex 1 :- npm install lodash@3.3.0
							       - Ex 1 :- npm install moment@2.1.0

- And By Executing This Cammand We dont need to specify the Latest patch Verion. We will Specify the Major and minor versions of the package that we require.
							       - command npm install <package_name>@<major_verison>.<major_verison>
							       - Ex 1 :- npm install moment@2.1
							       - Ex 1 :- npm install lodash@3.3

- And Also By Executing This Cammand We dont need to specify the Latest patch Verion and the Latest minor version. We will Only Specify the Major Version number of the package number that Want to install.
							       - command npm install <package_name>@<major_verison>.<major_verison>
							       - Ex 1 :- npm install moment@2
							       - Ex 1 :- npm install lodash@3
