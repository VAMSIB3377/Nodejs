12_Installing_From_Package.json

-- These packages will be installed from the dependency modules like momento, lodash etc.,

-- "^"  When we are working we may keep on getting updates on these packages and every time we can't change the package version.
        So, Here  '^'  is a Character Symbol that we use to mention the infront of the 
        module version like - "^3.0.0" in your package.json file, which will keep it updating automatically everytime the version of any of the package inside that particular module gets updated.
	   
-- "~"  Tilde symbol doesn't allow you to upgrade your module when you use it like "~3.0.0"
	But whenever you want to use the patch version only you can this in your package.json file.


-- "*"  Irrespective of the Major and Minor Versions of the modules it automatically upgrades the version of the package to its latest.
