15_NPM_Scripting

Step 1 -  Write a JS file where the node has been installed

Normally We Execute a NodeJs using the Command - node <filename.js>

But Here we to Excute the code By Using npm

Step 2 - In package.json file replace 'test' in 'scripts' with 'start' on L.H.S

Step 3 - And on R.H.S Side replace the text with "node <file_address.js>"

Step 4 - Now Excute this command in the command prompt - npm start
       - the code will start will executing



--->>> Here the Key Point is we can start a nodejs prog using 'npm start' 
       so, we no need to go to the program location everytime and run it.
       

--->>> and in normal cases when user used to use one application he tried searching many times,
       but he failed to get it , because creator of the app has updated its name.

--->>> In the same way as like the old when we try to use through node and the programmer changes the name of
       the program thn if we try to execute it with node using the node <filename> command we have we will get error.

--->>> To Correct this we should connect the program with package.json as said above.
       so that whenever we execute the npm command npm start there will be no errors starting the code.
       even if the programmer changes the name of the program also code runs same.
