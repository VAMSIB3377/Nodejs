Installing Local Package

Step1 - Command to install the Package Locally For a Specific Project --> npm install "<Command-Name>"

Step2 - moment - it is package from init - Which is Basically a JS Date Library.

Step3 - Command for Installing moment - npm install moment - will be installed in node_modules
      - If you're trying to install more packages they will also be installed in nod_modules only.

Step4 - In Older Verions the installation of Packages was executing the same Command but we were not able to see moment in our package.json file.
      - So, we used this command to save the package into the package.json by which we will be able to see.  --> npm install moment --save - which will also add an entry to the package as "dependencies"

      - But, after some of later versions they updated where the package will be saved automatically when we execute the first command itself i.e., --> npm install moment - which will also add an entry to the package as "dependencies"
       

Step5 - Tried to install Dev Package with command - init install lodash --save-dev
      - Unable to create a devdepeendencies but the package is under dependecies entry


Notes - 1. lodash is a dev dependency
	2. moment is production dependency



-	When We are Upating We Can Follow The same Way but Instead of install we have to give update in the command as follows - npm update moment --save
															       - npm update --savedev
