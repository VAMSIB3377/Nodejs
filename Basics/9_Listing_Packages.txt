Listing_Packages


- Some Times We Might Want to Have the list of Packages are installed Locally, Globally

- To View the List The Packages Some packages must Be There in the System


Local

- Execute the Command in cmd to Show the List of Local Packages Installed --> npm list

- If we execute this Command we will get the packages with no dependencies of Zero dependencies --> npm list --depth 0
												--> --> by incressing the count of depth we can see those packages which will have many in depth dependencies


Global

- Execute the Command in cmd to Show the List of Global Packages Installed --> npm list --global true
									  
- Here also If we execute this Command we will get the packages with no dependencies of Zero dependencies --> npm list --global true --depth 0
													  --> by incressing the count of depth we can see those packages which will have many in depth dependencies
